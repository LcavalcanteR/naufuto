Telegram Bot server that sends a sticker when someone sends an specific emoji (ðŸ”Š).

===================> Works only with python2.7. <===================

- It needs to be Admin to work with groups (I took a long time to figure it out)

Special thanks to:

â€“ Pius Laddenburguer. https://github.com/GittiHab - His bot helped me a lot to find the sticker ID on telegram servers.
â€“ Ayrton Cavalieri.   https://github.com/AyrtonC  - Personal friend who helped me with the idea of this bot.
